  <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Getting started</h1>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Things you need to set up</h2>
  <p style='font-weight: 700'>Gmail</p>
  <p>The user experience team use gmail as well as the official DWP email.</p>
  <p>Set up a gmail account in this format: {yourname}.digitaldwp@gmail.com.</p>
  <p style='font-weight: 700'>Trello</p>
  <p>Most projects and the user experience team use Trello to track work and tasks.</p>
  <p>Set up an account at www.trello.com, using your gmail account. You'll be invited or added to Trello boards.</p>
  <p style='font-weight: 700'>Design community</p>
  <p>The DWP user experience team is part of a wider design community in government, centred around GDS.</p>
  <p>Your line manager will get you added to the digital service designers email list.</p>
    <p style='font-weight: 700'>Slack</p>
  <p>The DWP user experience community and the Government-wide design community use slack instant messaging to ask questions and share ideas.</p>
  <p>Email <a>colinoakley.digitaldwp@gmail.com</a> from your gmail and ask him to add you to the digitalDWP slack channel.</p>
  <p>There are particular channels for each area - join at least the content and general channels.</p>
  <p>You can also join the ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com channel using your DWP email when you have it.</p>
  <p style='font-weight: 700'>Your timesheet</p>
    <p>Make your own copy of this <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfZPkY-EEOYfcRa_YWdiznbnLU31GJlWX1MbOeybqZM/edit?usp=sharing'>DWP timesheet</a> and add it to your google drive - update this at least weekly, ideally every day.</p>
  <p style='font-weight: 700'>Your bank details</p>
    <p>You need to put your own bank details into 'RM' - the internal staff system. To do this you'll need a DWP machine and your smartcard. You can't be paid until you've done this so don't forget.</p>
  <p style='font-weight: 700'>A business travel account</p>
    <p>Email cd.businesstravelpolicyteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk from your gsi email (you'll need a DWP machine). Include your staff number, and ask them to set up a www.trips.uk.com account - this is where you'll book work travel and accommodation</li></p>
