      <p>DWP business transformation group works to 'agile' principles.</p>
      <p>If you've never worked in an agile environment before it involves working at pace, usually releasing new features every 2 weeks.</p>
    	<p>You'll be expected to join in with agile 'ceremonies'. These include:</p>
		<ul class="list list-bullet">
			<li>daily stand ups - 10 minutes every morning when you tell the team what you'll be working on that day</li>
			<li>fortnightly 'show and tells' where you demonstrate to the team and others what you've produced in the last two weeks</li>
			<li>fortnightly 'retros' where you examine with the team what went well, what went wrong and what you can do differently next time</li> 
		</ul>
	<p>Each of your teams works differently but on your projects you'll be expected to work most closely with:</p>
	<ul class="list list-bullet">
		<li>Interaction designers</li>
		<li>User researchers</li>
		<li>Other content designers</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each team works in a set location but in a flexible way. You won't have a permanent desk. You can get a locker if you need one.</p>
	<p>You'll also have regular meetings with the User Experience community across DWP. Your head of role will let you know when these are happening and when.</p>
	<p>As well as collaborating in the office individuals are expected to join the government-wide digital community, and are encouraged to blog and speak publicly about the work we are doing to improve government services.</p>
	<h2 class="heading-medium">Locations</h2>
	<p>DWP has a 'hub' strategy for delivering digital services. This means there are several large offices delivering several services from each.</p>
	<p>Your home hub is <strong>Leeds ONE</strong> but you may need to go to the other hubs on occasion. These are:</p>
	<ul class="list list-bullet">
		<li>Newcastle, Longbenton, 

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Other things</h2>
